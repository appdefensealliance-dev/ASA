# Cloud Application Security Assessment
**Insert growth and importance of Mobile Applications and the importance of security and privacy**

The App Defense Alliance maintains a catalog of applications which have gone through 3rd party security assessments based on the OWASP Application Security Validation Standard (ASVS). Specifically, the portions of the standard found in the [ADA Cloud Security Guide (CSG)](https://github.com/EastOfTheShire/BEB/blob/main/CloudAppSecurity/Specification.md). The CGS is focused on Level 1 and Level 2 requirements which may be assessed by a third party. The assessment is focused on the 14 core elements from ASVS as viewed from the external interfaces to the cloud application. The ADA CSG is not focused on internal developer processes or cloud infrastructure. 

This repository is maintained by the ADA approved security assessment companies. We encourage input through the issues page from both security assessors and developers. If you are interested in becoming an ADA approved security assessor, please visit [www.appdefensealliance.dev](https://www.appdefensealliance.dev/)

# OWASP
The Open Web Application Security Project® (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. Through community-led open-source software projects, hundreds of local chapters worldwide, tens of thousands of members, and leading educational and training conferences, the OWASP Foundation is the source for developers and technologists to secure the web.

# ASVS
The primary aim of the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) Project is to provide an open application security standard for web apps and web services of all types.

The standard provides a basis for designing, building, and testing technical application security controls, including architectural concerns, secure development lifecycle, threat modelling, agile security including continuous integration / deployment, serverless, and configuration concerns. This standard is maintained by OWASP and can be found at this [link](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS).
