# Application Defense Alliance
The primary mission of the Application Defense Alliance is to ensure the safety of the Google and Android Ecosystem. This is accomplished through the adherence to industry defined security standards and validation with independent security assessors. The security standards are based on the OWASP Application Security Validation Standard (ASVS) and Mobile Application Security Validation Standards (MASVS). Though both standards provide great guidance for developers, the ADA community has created a Cloud Security Guide and Mobile Security Guide, which is focused on the portions of the OWASP standards which are verifiable by a third party without a full code review.

The ADA has several initiatives. Two of which are the [Cloud Application Security Assessment](https://github.com/appdefensealliance/ASA/tree/main/CloudAppSecurity) and [Mobile Application Security Assessment](https://github.com/appdefensealliance/ASA/tree/main/MobileAppSecurityAssessment) Initiatives are defined in this repository.
